    abstract = {Throughout the engineering design process, the design problem and design solutions may be represented by natural language, sketches, technical drawings, and process diagrams. Due to its ambiguity and flexibility, natural language processing has not been well integrated into the tools and methods assisting the design process. This paper proposes a new graphic language, called recursive object model (ROM), to represent natural language used in engineering, which are mainly composed by statements. The ROM uses only five basic symbols to represent object, compound object, constraint relationship, predicate relationship and connection relationship. Those five elements are derived mathematically and are proven sufficient for technical English through enumeration. Three case studies addressing different aspects of design are used to demonstrate the usefulness of the ROM.},

    abstract = {Eliciting precise and comprehensive product requirements from customers is of critical importance for the success of product development. In this paper, a generic process is proposed for eliciting product requirements by asking questions based on linguistic analysis. The linguistic analysis transforms a text into a graphic language called recursive object model (ROM). Two types of questions are asked in the process. One type of question, generated according to the topological structure of the ROM diagram, is domain-independent whereas the other relies on the domain of product development. A generic template is developed for generating the questions and for determining the sequence in which those questions are asked. The answers to the questions can be sought on the internet, in text books, the dictionary, the designer's own knowledge and experience, the customers and other partners involved in the product development, and/or nature itself. The generation of new questions may be based on the answers that are obtained. A software prototype is developed to support the proposed process. A case study of a rivet-setting tool design is used to illustrate the process of generating questions.},
